## Documentation

The documentation is available at https://api.jotform.com/docs/

Minor API changes have been made to use stronger typing, follow the method parameters for self explanatory usage.

## TODO

 - [ ] There is a property explorer, make sure it is up to date with the API
https://api.jotform.com/docs/properties/index.php
 - [ ] Add non-read operation tests
 - [ ] Question Types & response types should use different objects
